**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting and will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : January 4, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : Completed coding and understanding policy-iteration ;-)

**Thoughts** : not easy to see, that policy-iteration is more efficient than value-iteration

## Day 2 : January 5, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : Completed coding and understanding MC Q-Learning

**Thoughts** : still needs some debugging

## Day 3 : January 6, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : Advanced MC Q-Learning (running avarage) + debugging done

**Thoughts** : thought about running average by myself ;-)

## Day 4 : January 7, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : read some articles..

**Thoughts** : Teacher force maybe interesting for RNN learning SC2...

## Day 5 : January 7, 2019
 
**Today's Progress** : MC reading + watching youtube video

**Thoughts** : importance sampling is not to intuitive..
